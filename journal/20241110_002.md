# Project Overview

langchain_intro/ will help you get familiar with LangChain and equip you with the tools that you need to build the chatbot you saw in the demo, and it won’t be included in your final chatbot. You’ll cover this in Step 1.

data/
This directory has the raw system data stored as CSV files.

chatbot_api/

Directory for the FastAPI app that serves the chatbot as a REST endpoint, and it’s the core deliverable of this project. The chatbot_api/src/agents/ and chatbot_api/src/chains/ subdirectories contain the LangChain objects that comprise the chatbot.

tests/
This directory includes two scripts that test how fast the chatbot can answer a series of questions.

chatbot_frontend/
This directory contains the Streamlit app that interacts with the chatbot endpoint in chatbot_api/.

All the environment variables needed to build and run the chatbot will be stored in a .env file.

I deploy the code in chatbot_api and chatbot_frontend as Docker containers that’ll be orchestrated with Docker Compose.
