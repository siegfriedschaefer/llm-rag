Semantically comparing two versions of a file shouldn't be that difficult, now that we can use llms to accomplish it.
That's what I thought when my son told me that he had to read a new version of of DIN 4108-2 "Thermal protection and energy economy in buildings" â€“ "Part 2: Minimum requirements to thermal insulation".

I haven't been so wrong in a long time.
